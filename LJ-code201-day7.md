#LJ Code 201 - Day 7

##Going Deeper with Objects and Constructors
(from JavaScript and Jquery)
- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a frame of something from real life.
- in an object, the variables become properties (can be a string, number, boolean, array, or another object), and the functions become methods

(from "Understanding JavaScript Constructors by Faraz Kelhini)
- they are like regular functions, but we use them with the "new" keyword.
- they save time when you want to create multiple similar objects with the same properties and methods
- you always capitalize the name of the constructor to distinguish them from other regular functions
