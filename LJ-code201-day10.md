#LJ Code 201 - Day 10

#Embedding Video

For HTML5 we can use a video tag similar to an image source tag, and then add on the list of attributes needed before closing the tag.
- preload (tells the browser what to do when the page loads)
- none (the browser won't load until the user presses play)
- auto (the browser should automatically download the video as page loads)
- metadata (the browser collects info such as size, frame, track list etc.)
- src (specifies the path to the video)
- poster (choose an image to show while the video downloads)
- width,height (choose the size of the player in pixels)
- controls (indicates that the browser should supply its own controls for playback)
- autoplay (my favorite: specifies that the file should play automatically)
- loop (tells the video to keep playing after it ends)
