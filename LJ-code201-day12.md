#LJ Code 201 - Day 12

#Canvas

Did some extra reading on W3 Schools about the canvas element:
- it's a container for graphics
- it's a rectangular area on an HTML page, and by deault it has no border and no content
- always specify an id attribute, as well as a width and height attribute to define the size
- to add a border just use the style attribute

To-do later: a full canvas tutorial
